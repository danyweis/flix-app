require 'rails_helper'

# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes
# the MoviesHelper. For example:
#
# describe MovieHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
#     end
#   end
# end

# RSpec.describe MovieHelper, type: :helper do => got error because of MovieHelper and not MoviesHelper
RSpec.describe MoviesHelper, type: :helper do

  it 'returns' do
    # need to be written
  end

end
